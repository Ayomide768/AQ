    <h3>Nigerian History</h3>
    <ul>
      What is the oldest Nigerian history?
      The history of Nigeria can be traced to the earliest inhabitants whose remains date from at least 13,000 BC through early civilizations such as the Nok culture which began around 1500 BC.
      What was Nigeria before it was called Nigeria?
  In 1893, the Oil Rivers Protectorate was renamed Niger Coast Protectorate with Calabar as capital. In 1890, the British reportea Shaw suggested that the area be named “Nigeria” after the Niger River.
